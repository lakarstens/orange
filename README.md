# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Proctor buys a pupil ices,
  And hopes the boy will not resist
When he attempts to practise vices
  Few people even know exist.

The Quarry, fleeing from the outing,
  Sinks panting in the reeds and mud;
And Hearkens to the distant shouting
  That tells him they are out for blood.
