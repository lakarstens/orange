# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Drudge expends her life in mopping,
In emptying and filling pails; 
And she will do so, never stopping,
Until her strength entirely fails.

The Lazar, blessed with an appearance
Enough to give the strongest qualms.
Has little need of perseverance
In prompting a display of alms.

The Nun is fearfully bedevilled:
She runs about and moans and shrieks;
Her flesh is bruised, her clothes dishevelled:
She's been like this for weeks and weeks.  

The Proctor buys a pupil ices,
  And hopes the boy will not resist
When he attempts to practise vices
  Few people even know exist.  

The Quarry, fleeing from the outing,
  Sinks panting in the reeds and mud;
And Hearkens to the distant shouting
  That tells him they are out for blood.  

The Zouave used to war and battle
Would sooner take a life than not:
It scarcely has begun to prattle
When he impales the hapless tot.
