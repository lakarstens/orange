# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Drudge expends her life in mopping,
In emptying and filling pails; 
And she will do so, never stopping,
Until her strength entirely fails.

The Lazar, blessed with an appearance
Enough to give the strongest qualms.
Has little need of perseverance
In prompting a display of alms.
